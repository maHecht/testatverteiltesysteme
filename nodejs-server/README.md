## Overview
This server was initially generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project and was adapted afterwards for personal needs.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the web frontend to be able to interact with the blackboards:

```
open http://localhost:8080
```

To view the Swagger UI interface, so the definition of the RESTfulAPI:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```
